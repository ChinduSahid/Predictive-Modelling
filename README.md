Data imbalance is a common issue that occurs in real world data. It is important to understand what could happen if we do not take the effect of data imbalance into account, when we should use sampling methods to deal with data imbalance and what type of sampling method should we use.
This report gives a basic demonstration of the consequences of not handling data imbalance and how the model’s performance changes when sampling methods are used.
